# SnakesAndLadders

http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/SnakesAndLadders-Kata

Initial feature implementation of a snakes and ladders Kata designed to use and understand TDD principles and introduce myself to C#.

Future Considerations:

Public vs Private.
Variables can be accessed on base classes AKA player class which should be self contained.

Acceptance Test.
Look into testing for the entire program. Currently there is testing for individual components.

Player Eight needs buffing.
